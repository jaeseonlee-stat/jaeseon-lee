I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://artsci.tamu.edu/statistics/index.html) at Texas A&M University, where I have the fortune of being advised by Dr. [Suhasini Subba Rao](https://artsci.tamu.edu/statistics/contact/profiles/suhasini-subba-rao.html) and am primarily focused on theoretical time series analysis. Also, I am honored to be a recipient of Hagler Institute Heep Fellowship from Hagler Institute for Advanced Study at Texas A&M, allowing me to work with Dr. [Alicia L. Carriquiry](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/people/alicia-carriquiry) on applying Bayesian methods across various domains, including nutrition.
